# Early-Sepsis-Detection
Sepsis is a Life Threatening Disease. We try to detect sepsis early atleat 6 hours before, so that it could save lives. We have used the actual patient data from hospitals for training our model. We have achieved a good accuracy of 97% with a good precision & recall, given that it's an extreme imbalance problem.
